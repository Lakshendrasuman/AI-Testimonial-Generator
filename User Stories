# User Story: Testimonial Aggregation

## Title
As a marketer, I want to aggregate testimonials from multiple sources, so I can centralize feedback for asset creation.

## Description
Marketers need to collect testimonials from X, Google Reviews, and surveys without manual copy-pasting. This feature allows users to connect APIs or upload CSVs, view testimonials in a dashboard, and filter them by source or sentiment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given I have an X or Google Reviews account, I can connect it via API to pull testimonials automatically.
- Given I have a CSV file with fields (`customer_name`, `testimonial_text`, `source`, `date`), I can upload it to import testimonials.
- Given I am on the dashboard, I can view a table of all testimonials with columns: Customer Name, Text, Source, Date, Sentiment (Positive/Negative/Neutral).
- Given I want to find specific testimonials, I can filter by source (e.g., X) or sentiment (e.g., Positive) and sort by date.
- Given I upload an invalid CSV (e.g., missing fields), I receive an error message with guidance to fix it.


## Assumptions
- Users have access to X/Google Reviews APIs or valid CSV exports.
- Sentiment analysis uses a basic AI model to categorize testimonials.

## Dependencies
- API integrations with X and Google My Business.
- Backend support for CSV parsing and validation.

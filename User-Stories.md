# User Stories: AI-Powered Testimonial Generator

## Overview
These user stories define the requirements for the AI-Powered Testimonial Generator, a SaaS platform that automates the transformation of customer testimonials into marketing assets (e.g., social media posts, case studies, sales decks). The platform aggregates testimonials, leverages AI for content generation, integrates with CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), provides analytics, and offers a template library. These stories target marketers and sales teams, ensuring user-centric design and seamless workflows.

## 1. Testimonial Aggregation
- **Title**: As a marketer, I want to aggregate testimonials from multiple sources, so I can centralize feedback for asset creation.
- **Description**: Marketers need to collect testimonials from X, Google Reviews, and surveys without manual copy-pasting. This feature allows users to connect APIs or upload CSVs, view testimonials in a dashboard, and filter them by source or sentiment.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Given I have an X or Google Reviews account, I can connect it via API to pull testimonials automatically.
  - Given I have a CSV file with fields (`customer_name`, `testimonial_text`, `source`, `date`), I can upload it to import testimonials.
  - Given I am on the dashboard, I can view a table of all testimonials with columns: Customer Name, Text, Source, Date, Sentiment (Positive/Negative/Neutral).
  - Given I want to find specific testimonials, I can filter by source (e.g., X) or sentiment (e.g., Positive) and sort by date.
  - Given I upload an invalid CSV (e.g., missing fields), I receive an error message with guidance to fix it.
- **Priority**: High (core feature for MVP, Q3 2025).
- **Assumptions**: Users have access to X/Google Reviews APIs or valid CSV exports; sentiment analysis uses a basic AI model.
- **Dependencies**: API integrations with X and Google My Business; backend for CSV parsing.

## 2. AI Asset Generation
- **Title**: As a marketer, I want to generate marketing assets from a testimonial in one click, so I can save time on content creation.
- **Description**: Marketers need to quickly turn testimonials into formats like social posts, case studies, or sales decks with customizable tones. This feature provides an asset editor to select formats, adjust tones, and preview outputs.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Given I select a testimonial, I can choose a format (X post, case study, sales deck) from a dropdown.
  - Given I choose a format, I can select a tone (professional, conversational, enthusiastic) and length (e.g., 280 characters for X).
  - Given I generate an asset, I can preview the output in the editor and make manual edits before saving.
  - Given I generate an X post, the output respects the 280-character limit and includes hashtags relevant to the industry (e.g., #SaaSSuccess).
  - Given I generate a case study, the output follows a template with sections: Customer Background, Challenge, Solution, Results.
  - Given I save an asset, it appears in my dashboard under “Generated Assets” with a download option (PDF for case studies, PPTX for decks).
- **Priority**: High (core feature for MVP, Q3 2025).
- **Assumptions**: AI model supports tone customization and format-specific templates; users are familiar with basic content editing.
- **Dependencies**: Fine-tuned LLM for content generation; frontend for asset editor.

## 3. CRM Integration
- **Title**: As a sales manager, I want to sync generated assets to my CRM, so I can use them in client outreach without manual uploads.
- **Description**: Sales teams need seamless access to marketing assets in Salesforce or HubSpot. This feature allows users to connect CRMs, map assets to fields, and sync with error handling.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Given I have a Salesforce or HubSpot account, I can connect it via OAuth 2.0 from the settings page.
  - Given I select an asset, I can map it to a CRM object (e.g., Salesforce Opportunity, HubSpot Deal) and field (e.g., Notes, Attachments).
  - Given I initiate a sync, the system pushes the asset to the CRM and confirms success with a notification.
  - Given a sync fails (e.g., API rate limit), I receive an error message with a retry option.
  - Given I view my sync history, I can see a log of successful and failed syncs with timestamps and asset IDs.
- **Priority**: Medium (Phase 2 feature, Q4 2025).
- **Assumptions**: Salesforce and HubSpot APIs support asset syncing with standard objects; users have admin access to CRM accounts.
- **Dependencies**: Backend for OAuth 2.0 and CRM APIs; database for sync logs.

## 4. Analytics Dashboard
- **Title**: As a marketer, I want to track the performance of generated assets, so I can optimize my marketing campaigns.
- **Description**: Marketers need insights into how assets perform in terms of engagement and conversions. This feature provides a dashboard with charts, filters, and exportable reports.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Given I am on the dashboard, I can view a bar chart showing click-through rates (CTR) for social posts by asset type (e.g., X vs. LinkedIn).
  - Given I want to analyze conversions, I can see a table of assets linked to sales (e.g., case study views → deals closed) with conversion rates.
  - Given I want specific data, I can filter analytics by asset type, campaign, or time period (e.g., last 30 days).
  - Given I identify a top-performing asset, the dashboard highlights it with a “Top Asset” badge and metrics (e.g., 10% CTR).
  - Given I need to share data, I can export a report as CSV or PDF with all dashboard metrics.
  - Given I view analytics, data refreshes in real-time with a maximum 5-second delay.
- **Priority**: Medium (Phase 1 for basic analytics, Q3 2025; advanced in Q4 2025).
- **Assumptions**: Engagement data is available via API tracking (e.g., X Analytics, CRM conversion tracking); users understand basic analytics metrics.
- **Dependencies**: Backend for analytics processing; frontend for chart visualizations.

## 5. Template Library
- **Title**: As a marketer, I want to use pre-built templates for asset creation, so I can generate assets quickly and consistently.
- **Description**: Marketers need a library of templates to streamline asset generation. This feature offers pre-built formats, industry categorization, and custom template saving.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Given I access the template library, I can browse 10+ pre-built templates (e.g., “X Post - Product Launch,” “Case Study - SaaS”).
  - Given I select a template, the system auto-populates it with a chosen testimonial’s content.
  - Given I customize a template (e.g., change headline), I can save it as a new custom template for reuse.
  - Given I browse templates, I can filter by industry (e.g., e-commerce, SaaS) or format (e.g., social post).
  - Given I apply a template, the generated asset adheres to format-specific rules (e.g., 280 characters for X posts).
- **Priority**: Medium (Phase 1 feature, Q3 2025).
- **Assumptions**: Users prefer pre-built templates for speed; backend supports template storage.
- **Dependencies**: Database for template storage; frontend for library interface.

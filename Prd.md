## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The AI-Powered Testimonial Generator is a SaaS platform that automates the transformation of raw customer testimonials into polished marketing assets (e.g., social media posts, case studies, sales decks). It aggregates testimonials from multiple sources, leverages AI for content generation, and integrates with CRMs like Salesforce and HubSpot to streamline marketing and sales workflows.
